    <h2>Where is my data stored?</h2>
    <p>
      All your contacts are stored locally in your browser using <b>LocalStorage</b>. This means only you have access to your data. If you clear your browser data, your contacts will be deleted.
    </p>

    <h2>Can I use this app on my phone?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes! The Address Book is fully responsive and works on smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
    </p>

    <h2>How can I backup or transfer my contacts?</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, there is no built-in export/import feature. However, you can manually copy your contacts from LocalStorage if you are comfortable with browser developer tools. Future versions may include an export/import option.
